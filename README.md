### 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering – Front-End Program**, where I’m developing hands-on skills in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design**.  
I started my software engineering journey because I believe that **technology is one of the most powerful tools to tackle global sustainability challenges**.  

What inspires me is the ability to **turn code into solutions that improve lives and protect our planet** — from climate data visualization to eco-friendly web experiences.  

💡 **My aim is to** create scalable, user-centered digital platforms that promote environmental awareness and sustainable development.  
That’s why I’d like to work on **projects that bridge technology and sustainability**, such as:
- 🌍 Green-tech dashboards  
- 📊 Environmental data visualization apps  
- 🌿 Climate resilience tools for local communities  
- 💻 Open-source sustainability initiatives
